# What is it?
* It's an external "trainer" for the game ['Dishonored'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/Dishonored/).
* The game is not supported on Linux, so this targets Windows only.

# How to use
* Compile for windows.
* There are no external dependencies, except for the windows api.
* Run it, and the display should pop up in your cmd window, giving you the default keybindings.
* You can change the default keybindings in config.ini, which will get generated on the first launch.
* [Use this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) as a reference for virtual key codes.
* If there's a feature you want, or a bug you want to fix, then submit a pull request or open an issue.
